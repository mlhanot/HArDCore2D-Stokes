The scripts provided here enable you to run the schemes on a series of meshes and with selected parameters (all detailed in data.sh).

Each runseries.sh script assumes certain locations for your directories (build, etc.). These variables have to be adjusted in a 'directory.sh' file in this folder; use the provided 'directories-template.sh' to fill in the correct information for your system.

Stokes does not follow the same template yet and must be run differently.
